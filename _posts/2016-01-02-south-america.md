Thanks to the organization [Remote Year][0], I've been offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel the world for a full year while working remotely with my current companies here in the States.

Starting this March (so soon!), I'll be working remotely from Argentina, and then Bolivia, Peru, and many other amazing countries throughout South America, Europe and Asia. There will be a cohort of 75 of us from 15 different countries, working and traveling side by side, learning from each other and the cultures we're engrained in. Over the course of the year we will spend a month each in 12 different cities spanning 11 countries before returning home.

The amount of support from my team members at [Hopscratch][1] and [Truce][2] has been overwhelming, and even brought me to tears multiple times (I couldn't do this trip without them, and one of them is actually going as well). With no hesitation at all, I've received nothing but encouragement. Words can't express the level of gratitude and love I have for all of them. We're in this for the long haul and will overcome the inherent challenges that will arise from not sharing an office together. They have showed me what it truly means to put love first.

So while I'm sure it will be a difficult, anxious, but equally exciting good bye, I know the year is going to fly by and I'll be back in the States before I know it. In the meantime, if you're looking for a vacation, you have a place to stay. Below is where you'll be able to find us!
